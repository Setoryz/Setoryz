### Hey there, I’m Seyi 👋

<p>
I'm a software engineer with a strong background in frontend engineering (React, Next.js, TypeScript) and a growing passion for backend systems and infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
These days, when I'm not shipping user interfaces, I'm knee-deep in YAML files, playing with Kubernetes clusters, automating deployments with Terraform and Ansible, or tuning Go APIs for performance.
</p>
